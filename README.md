# Brain-tumor-detectio
Hi, I’m Mohith Charan Reddy, a student exploring the power of AI in healthcare. This project is all about detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Project Overview

Built with CNNs, this system processes MRI images to classify or locate brain tumors (e.g., gliomas, meningiomas). It’s designed to assist early diagnosis, combining tech and medicine for real impact. The model is coded in  Python and powered by Tensorflow and pytorch

How It Works

Input: MRI scans (preprocessed for clarity).
CNN Magic: Layers of convolution and pooling detect tumor patterns.
Output: Tumor presence (yes/no) or highlighted tumor regions.
Accuracy: 96%
Tech Details

Language: Python
Framework: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV for preprocessing
Dataset: Kaggle Brain MRI

Why CNNs?

CNNs excel at image recognition, making them perfect for spotting subtle tumor signs in complex MRI scans. This project pushes their limits to save time and lives.
